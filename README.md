# HTML Service

## Introduction

A C# 10 / .NET 6 minimal API example API that generates html

## Developing

It was created using **Visual Studio 17.0.0 Preview 3.1**.  As this is a pre-release, earlier or later versions might not work as expected.

## Goals

- [ ] Use the new `Minimal API` approach to defining endpoints
- [ ] Use `versioned` routes
- [ ] Use `model validation` to validate requests
- [ ] Use `Razor` templates to define html templates
- [ ] Use [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
- [ ] Use modern C# features, such as [top-level statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements) along with `Global using directives`
and `File-scoped namespace declaration` as defined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10)
