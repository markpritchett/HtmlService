# HTML Service

## Introduction

A C# 10 / .NET 6 minimal API example service that generates html

## Developing

Last updated with  **Visual Studio Version 17.0.0 Preview 4.1** and **6.0.100-rc.1.21463.6**.  As this is a pre-release, earlier or later versions might not work as expected.

## Goals

- [x] Use the new `Minimal API` approach to defining endpoints
- [x] Use `versioned` routes
- [x] Use `model validation` to validate requests
- [x] Use `Razor` templates to define html templates
- [x] Use [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
- [x] Use modern C# features, such as [top-level statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements) along with `Global using directives`
and `File-scoped namespace declaration` as defined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10)
